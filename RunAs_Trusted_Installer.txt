WOF_Compress_x64.exe needs to be Trusted Installer in case of Path with Windows Operating System folders

Solution
- Double-click WOF_Compress_Trusted.cmd so that AdvancedRun.exe is used to Run as Trusted Installer program WOF_Compress_x64.exe

Or
- Use Wof Compress Tool Checkbox in program WOF_Compress_x64.exe to be Trusted Installer
- Or always be Trusted Installer in Win10XPE Environment
- Or Run RunAsTI64.exe first and then launch WOF_Compress_x64.exe from Command Window - See WOF_Compr_2020-07-27_200739.jpg
  In this case WARNING - Location systemprofile\Desktop missing occurs that you simply must close and can proceed
