Description
===========

Starting from Windows Vista, Microsoft uses symbolic links and junction
points of NTFS file system in order to make changes in the folders
structure of Windows and keep the compatibility of applications written
for older versions of Windows. This utility simply shows you a list of
all symbolic links and junctions in the specified folder, and their
target paths. It also allows you to save the symbolic links/junctions
list into text/html/xml/csv file.



Using NTFSLinksView
===================

NTFSLinksView doesn't require any installation process or additional dll
files. In order to start using it, simply run the executable file -
NTFSLinksView.exe

When you run NTFSLinksView, press the Go button, and then the main window
will display the list of all NTFS symbolic links/junction points in your
profile folder. If you want to view the NTFS links in other folders,
simply type the folder path in the top text-box and press enter (or click
the 'Go' button).

If you want to scan your entire drive, type 'C:\' in the folder text box
and choose Infinite subfolder depth.
