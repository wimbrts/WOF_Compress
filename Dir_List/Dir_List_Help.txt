
- Dir_List Folder with Programs Dir_List_x64.exe and Hard_Link_List_x64.exe

- Dir_List_x64.exe allows to select a folder so that Folder_List and File_List of that Path are created

- Hard_Link_List_x64.exe allows to select a folder so that first Folder_List and File_List are created
  Then Hard_Link_List_x64.exe auto uses h_list.cmd and File_List to create Single_Hard_Link_List and Multi_Hard_Link_List

- Program h_list.cmd can be used separately in Admin command window with File_List (can be modified) as parameter 
  e.g. File_List_P_WinSxS.txt as parameter to search in P:\Windows\WinSxS folder for Single Or Multi Hard_Link data

- Program h_sxs.cmd can be used in Admin command window with Windows Path as parameter for search in WinSxS folder 
  e.g. P:\Windows as parameter to search in P:\Windows\WinSxS folder for Single Or Multi Hard_Link data
  In the search in WinSxS folder then the folders Backup, Catalogs and FileMaps are excluded in case of using h_sxs.cmd

- Program h_path.cmd can be used in Admin command window with any Path as parameter for search of type of Hard_Link data in that Path
  e.g. P:\Windows\System32 as parameter to search in P:\Windows\System32 folder for Single Or Multi Hard_Link data

- Output in all cases is Single_Hard_Link_List_YYYY-MM-DD.txt and Multi_Hard_Link_List_YYYY-MM-DD.txt files

You might use Dir_List to make File_List and use notepad++  with  Plugins > Compare option to Compare File_Lists
